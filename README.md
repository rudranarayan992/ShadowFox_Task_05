# ShadowFox_Task_05
Python program simulating a six-sided die roll and a jumping jacks workout routine with interactive user input and statistics tracking.


# ShadowFox Internship - Task 05

## 🔍 Task Objective

This task involves creating a Python program that combines two mini-projects:

### 🎲 Part 1: Die Roll Simulation
- Simulate rolling a six-sided die **at least 20 times**.
- Track and display:
  - How many times you rolled a **6**.
  - How many times you rolled a **1**.
  - How many times you rolled **two 6s in a row**.

### 🏋️‍♂️ Part 2: Jumping Jacks Workout
- Simulate a **100-jumping-jacks workout**, broken into sets of 10.
- After each set:
  - Ask the user: `"Are you tired?"`
  - If user replies `"yes"` or `"y"`, ask: `"Do you want to skip the remaining sets?"`
    - If yes, break and print how many jumping jacks were completed.
  - If user says `"no"` or `"n"`, continue and print the remaining jumping jacks.
- If the user completes all 100, print: `"Congratulations! You completed the workout."`
